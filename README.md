# Zero-to-Hero-SQL
I am documenting my learning journey toward becoming an SQL expert.

I separated the SQL learning journey into 3 parts. 
  Beginner: DB creation, Select, Where, Group By, AND, OR, IN, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, COUNT, AVG, MAX and MIN.
  Intermediate: JOINS, ALIAS, STRING, CASE STATEMENT, WINDOW FUNCTOIN.
  Advanced level: CTE, TEMP TABLE, TRIGGERS AND EVENT, DATA CLEANING.
