I am documenting my learning journey toward becoming an SQL expert. This is a self-teaching lerning by doing method

I separated the SQL learning journey into 3 parts. 
  - Beginner: DB creation, Select, Where, Group By, AND, OR, IN, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, COUNT, AVG, MAX and MIN.
  - Intermediate: JOINS, ALIAS, STRING, CASE STATEMENT, WINDOW FUNCTOIN.
  - Advanced level: CTE, TEMP TABLE, TRIGGERS AND EVENT, DATA CLEANING.

The db i use is: Beginner - Parks_and_Rec_Create_db.
The db has 3 tables:
  - employee_demographics
  - employee_salary
  - parks_departments

Beginner Queries: Beginner_Queries.sql
Intermediate: Intermediate_Queries.sql
